= Workload with Ingress Quick Start
:experimental:

=== Prerequisite

You have a running cluster with at least 1 node.

=== 1. Deploying a Workload

You're ready to create your first Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/[workload]. A workload is an object that includes pods along with other files and info needed to deploy your application.

For this workload, you'll be deploying the application Rancher Hello-World.

. From the *Clusters* page, open the cluster that you just created.
. From the main menu of the *Dashboard*, select *Projects/Namespaces*.
. Open the *Project: Default* project.
. Click menu:Resources[Workloads.]
. Click *Deploy*.
+
*Step Result:* The *Deploy Workload* page opens.

. Enter a *Name* for your workload.
. From the *Docker Image* field, enter `rancher/hello-world`. This field is case-sensitive.
. Leave the remaining options on their default setting. We'll tell you about them later.
. Click *Launch*.

*Result:*

* Your workload is deployed. This process might take a few minutes to complete.
* When your workload completes deployment, it's assigned a state of *Active*. You can view this status from the project's *Workloads* page.

=== 2. Expose The Application Via An Ingress

Now that the application is up and running it needs to be exposed so that other services can connect.

. From the *Clusters* page, open the cluster that you just created.
. From the main menu of the *Dashboard*, select *Projects*.
. Open the *Default* project.
. Click menu:Resources[Workloads > Load Balancing.] Click on the *Load Balancing* tab.
. Click *Add Ingress*.
. Enter a name i.e. *hello*.
. In the *Target* field, drop down the list and choose the name that you set for your service.
. Enter `80` in the *Port* field.
. Leave everything else as default and click *Save*.

*Result:*  The application is assigned a `sslip.io` address and exposed. It may take a minute or two to populate.

=== View Your Application

From the *Load Balancing* page, click the target link, which will look something like `hello.default.xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.sslip.io > hello-world`.

Your application will open in a separate window.

==== Finished

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a workload exposed via an ingress.

==== What's Next?

When you're done using your sandbox, destroy the Rancher Server and your cluster. See one of the following:

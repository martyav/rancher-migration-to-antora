= Managing HPAs with the Rancher UI
:experimental:

The Rancher UI supports creating, managing, and deleting HPAs. You can configure CPU or memory usage as the metric that the HPA uses to scale.

If you want to create HPAs that scale based on other metrics than CPU and memory, refer to link:manage-hpas-with-kubectl.adoc#configuring-hpa-to-scale-using-custom-metrics-with-prometheus[Configuring HPA to Scale Using Custom Metrics with Prometheus].

== Creating an HPA

. From the *Global* view, open the project that you want to deploy a HPA to.
. Click menu:Resources[HPA.]
. Click *Add HPA.*
. Enter a *Name* for the HPA.
. Select a *Namespace* for the HPA.
. Select a *Deployment* as scale target for the HPA.
. Specify the *Minimum Scale* and *Maximum Scale* for the HPA.
. Configure the metrics for the HPA. You can choose memory or CPU usage as the metric that will cause the HPA to scale the service up or down. In the *Quantity* field, enter the percentage of the workload's memory or CPU usage that will cause the HPA to scale the service. To configure other HPA metrics, including metrics available from Prometheus, you need to link:manage-hpas-with-kubectl.adoc#configuring-hpa-to-scale-using-custom-metrics-with-prometheus[manage HPAs using kubectl].
. Click *Create* to create the HPA.

____
*Result:* The HPA is deployed to the chosen namespace. You can view the HPA's status from the project's Resources > HPA view.

== Get HPA Metrics and Status

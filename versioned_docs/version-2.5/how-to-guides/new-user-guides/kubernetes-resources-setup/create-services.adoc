= Service Discovery

For every workload created, a complementing Service Discovery entry is created. This Service Discovery entry enables DNS resolution for the workload's pods using the following naming convention:
`<workload>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`.

However, you also have the option of creating additional Service Discovery records. You can use these additional records so that a given namespace resolves with one or more external IP addresses, an external hostname, an alias to another DNS record, other workloads, or a set of pods that match a selector that you create.

. From the *Global* view, open the project that you want to add a DNS record to.
. Click *Resources* in the main navigation bar. Click the *Service Discovery* tab. Then click *Add Record*.
. Enter a *Name* for the DNS record. This name is used for DNS resolution.
. Select a *Namespace* from the drop-down list. Alternatively, you can create a new namespace on the fly by clicking *Add to a new namespace*.
. Select one of the *Resolves To* options to route requests to the DNS record.
 .. *One or more external IP addresses*
+
Enter an IP address in the *Target IP Addresses* field. Add more IP addresses by clicking *Add Target IP*.

 .. *An external hostname*
+
Enter a *Target Hostname*.

 .. *Alias of another DNS record's value*
+
Click *Add Target Record* and select another DNS record from the *Value* drop-down.

 .. *One or more workloads*
+
Click *Add Target Workload* and select another workload from the *Value* drop-down.

 .. *The set of pods which match a selector*
+
Enter key value pairs of https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors[label selectors] to create a record for all pods that match your parameters.
. Click *Create*

*Result:* A new DNS record is created.

* You can view the record by from the project's *Service Discovery* tab.
* When you visit the new DNS name for the new record that you created (`<recordname>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`), it resolves the chosen namespace.

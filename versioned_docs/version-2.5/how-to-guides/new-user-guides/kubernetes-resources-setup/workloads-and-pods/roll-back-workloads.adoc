= Rolling Back Workloads
:experimental:

Sometimes there is a need to rollback to the previous version of the application, either for debugging purposes or because an upgrade did not go as planned.

. From the *Global* view, open the project running the workload you want to rollback.
. Find the workload that you want to rollback and select menu:Vertical &#8942; (... )[Rollback].
. Choose the revision that you want to roll back to. Click *Rollback*.

*Result:* Your workload reverts to the previous version that you chose. Wait a few minutes for the action to complete.

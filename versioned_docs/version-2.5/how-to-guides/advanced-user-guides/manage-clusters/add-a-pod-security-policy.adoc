= Adding a Pod Security Policy
:experimental:

____
*Prerequisite:* The options below are available only for clusters that are xref:../../new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/launch-kubernetes-with-rancher/launch-kubernetes-with-rancher.adoc[launched using RKE.]
____

When your cluster is running pods with security-sensitive configurations, assign it a xref:../authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/create-pod-security-policies.adoc[pod security policy], which is a set of rules that monitors the conditions and settings in your pods. If a pod doesn't meet the rules specified in your policy, the policy stops it from running.

You can assign a pod security policy when you provision a cluster. However, if you need to relax or restrict security for your pods later, you can update the policy while editing your cluster.

. From the *Global* view, find the cluster to which you want to apply a pod security policy. Select menu:&#8942;[Edit].
. Expand *Cluster Options*.
. From *Pod Security Policy Support*, select *Enabled*.
+
NOTE: This option is only available for clusters xref:../../new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/launch-kubernetes-with-rancher/launch-kubernetes-with-rancher.adoc[provisioned by RKE].

. From the *Default Pod Security Policy* drop-down, select the policy you want to apply to the cluster.
+
Rancher ships with link:../authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/create-pod-security-policies.adoc#default-psps[policies] of `restricted` and `unrestricted`, although you can link:../authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/create-pod-security-policies.adoc#creating-psps[create custom policies] as well.

. Click *Save*.

*Result:* The pod security policy is applied to the cluster and any projects within the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Workloads already running before assignment of a pod security policy are grandfathered in. Even if they don't meet your pod security policy, workloads running before assignment of the policy continue to run.

To check if a running workload passes your pod security policy, clone or upgrade it.

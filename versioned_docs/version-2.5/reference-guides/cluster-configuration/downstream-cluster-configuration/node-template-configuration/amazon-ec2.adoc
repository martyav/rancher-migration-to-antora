=== Authenticate & Configure Nodes

Choose an availability zone and network settings for your cluster.

=== Security Group

Choose the default security group or configure a security group.

Please refer to link:../../../../getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/installation-requirements/port-requirements.adoc#rancher-aws-ec2-security-group[Amazon EC2 security group when using Node Driver] to see what rules are created in the `rancher-nodes` Security Group.

=== Instance Options

Configure the instances that will be created. Make sure you configure the correct *SSH User* for the configured AMI. It is possible that a selected region does not support the default instance type. In this scenario you must select an instance type that does exist, otherwise an error will occur stating the requested configuration is not supported.

If you need to pass an *IAM Instance Profile Name* (not ARN), for example, when you want to use a xref:../../../../how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/launch-kubernetes-with-rancher/set-up-cloud-providers/set-up-cloud-providers.adoc[Kubernetes Cloud Provider], you will need an additional permission in your policy. See link:../../../../how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/launch-kubernetes-with-rancher/use-new-nodes-in-an-infra-provider/create-an-amazon-ec2-cluster.adoc#example-iam-policy-with-passrole[Example IAM policy with PassRole] for an example policy.

=== Engine Options

In the *Engine Options* section of the node template, you can configure the Docker daemon. You may want to specify the docker version or a Docker registry mirror.

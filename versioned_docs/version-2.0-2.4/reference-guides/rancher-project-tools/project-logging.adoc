= Project Logging
:experimental:

Rancher can integrate with a variety of popular logging services and tools that exist outside of your Kubernetes clusters.

For background information about how logging integrations work, refer to the link:../../explanations/integrations-in-rancher/cluster-logging/cluster-logging.adoc#how-logging-integrations-work[cluster administration section.]

Rancher supports the following services:

* Elasticsearch
* Splunk
* Kafka
* Syslog
* Fluentd

NOTE: You can only configure one logging service per cluster or per project.

Only xref:../../how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/global-permissions.adoc[administrators], link:../../how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/cluster-and-project-roles.adoc#cluster-roles[cluster owners or members], or link:../../how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/cluster-and-project-roles.adoc#project-roles[project owners] can configure Rancher to send Kubernetes logs to a logging service.

== Requirements

The Docker daemon on each node in the cluster should be https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/configure/[configured] with the (default) log-driver: `json-file`. You can check the log-driver by running the following command:

 $ docker info | grep 'Logging Driver'
 Logging Driver: json-file

== Advantages

Setting up a logging service to collect logs from your cluster/project has several advantages:

* Logs errors and warnings in your Kubernetes infrastructure to a stream. The stream informs you of events like a container crashing, a pod eviction, or a node dying.
* Allows you to capture and analyze the state of your cluster and look for trends in your environment using the log stream.
* Helps you when troubleshooting or debugging.
* Saves your logs to a safe location outside of your cluster, so that you can still access them even if your cluster encounters issues.

== Logging Scope

You can configure logging at either cluster level or project level.

* xref:../../explanations/integrations-in-rancher/cluster-logging/cluster-logging.adoc[Cluster logging] writes logs for every pod in the cluster, i.e. in all the projects. For xref:../../how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/launch-kubernetes-with-rancher/launch-kubernetes-with-rancher.adoc[RKE clusters], it also writes logs for all the Kubernetes system components.
* Project logging writes logs for every pod in that particular project.

Logs that are sent to your logging service are from the following locations:

* Pod logs stored at `/var/log/containers`.
* Kubernetes system components logs stored at `/var/lib/rancher/rke/logs/`.

== Enabling Project Logging

. From the *Global* view, navigate to the project that you want to configure project logging.
. Select menu:Tools[Logging] in the navigation bar. In versions before v2.2.0, you can choose menu:Resources[Logging].
. Select a logging service and enter the configuration. Refer to the specific service for detailed configuration. Rancher supports the following services:
 ** xref:../../explanations/integrations-in-rancher/cluster-logging/elasticsearch.adoc[Elasticsearch]
 ** xref:../../explanations/integrations-in-rancher/cluster-logging/splunk.adoc[Splunk]
 ** xref:../../explanations/integrations-in-rancher/cluster-logging/kafka.adoc[Kafka]
 ** xref:../../explanations/integrations-in-rancher/cluster-logging/syslog.adoc[Syslog]
 ** xref:../../explanations/integrations-in-rancher/cluster-logging/fluentd.adoc[Fluentd]
. (Optional) Instead of using the UI to configure the logging services, you can enter custom advanced configurations by clicking on *Edit as File*, which is located above the logging targets. This link is only visible after you select a logging service.
 ** With the file editor, enter raw fluentd configuration for any logging service. Refer to the documentation for each logging service on how to setup the output configuration.

 ** If the logging service is using TLS, you also need to complete the *SSL Configuration* form.
  ... Provide the *Client Private Key* and *Client Certificate*. You can either copy and paste them or upload them by using the *Read from a file* button.
   **** You can use either a self-signed certificate or one provided by a certificate authority.
   **** You can generate a self-signed certificate using an openssl command. For example:
+
----
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout myservice.key -out myservice.cert -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=myservice.example.com"
----
  ... If you are using a self-signed certificate, provide the *CA Certificate PEM*.
. (Optional) Complete the *Additional Logging Configuration* form.
 .. *Optional:* Use the *Add Field* button to add custom log fields to your logging configuration. These fields are key value pairs (such as `foo=bar`) that you can use to filter the logs from another system.
 .. Enter a *Flush Interval*. This value determines how often https://www.fluentd.org/[Fluentd] flushes data to the logging server. Intervals are measured in seconds.
 .. *Include System Log*. The logs from pods in system project and RKE components will be sent to the target. Uncheck it to exclude the system logs.
. Click *Test*. Rancher sends a test log to the service.
+
NOTE: This button is replaced with _Dry Run_ if you are using the custom configuration editor. In this case, Rancher calls the fluentd dry run command to validate the configuration.

. Click *Save*.

*Result:* Rancher is now configured to send logs to the selected service. Log into the logging service so that you can start viewing the logs.

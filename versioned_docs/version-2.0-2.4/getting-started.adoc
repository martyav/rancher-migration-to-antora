= Getting Started

To get up and running with Rancher quickly, we have included a *Getting Started* section.

The goal of this section is to be able to assist users in deploying Rancher and workloads and to install or upgrade Rancher quickly and effectively.

Please see the xref:getting-started/introduction/introduction.adoc[introduction], xref:getting-started/quick-start-guides/quick-start-guides.adoc[quick start guides], and the xref:getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/installation-and-upgrade.adoc[installation and upgrade] sections for more.

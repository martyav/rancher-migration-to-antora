= CLI with Rancher

Interact with Rancher using command line interface (CLI) tools from your workstation.

== Rancher CLI

Follow the steps in xref:../../reference-guides/cli-with-rancher/cli-with-rancher.adoc[rancher cli].

Ensure you can run `rancher kubectl get pods` successfully.

== kubectl

Install the `kubectl` utility. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[install kubectl].

Configure kubectl by visiting your cluster in the Rancher Web UI then clicking on `Kubeconfig`, copying contents and putting into your `~/.kube/config` file.

Run `kubectl cluster-info` or `kubectl get pods` successfully.

== Authentication with kubectl and kubeconfig Tokens with TTL

_*Available as of v2.4.6*_

_Requirements_

If admins have link:../../reference-guides/about-the-api/api-tokens.adoc#setting-ttl-on-kubeconfig-tokens[enforced TTL on kubeconfig tokens], the kubeconfig file requires the xref:cli.adoc[Rancher cli] to be present in your PATH when you run `kubectl`. Otherwise, you'll see error like:
`Unable to connect to the server: getting credentials: exec: exec: "rancher": executable file not found in $PATH`.

This feature enables kubectl to authenticate with the Rancher server and get a new kubeconfig token when required. The following auth providers are currently supported:

. Local
. Active Directory
. FreeIpa, OpenLdap
. SAML providers - Ping, Okta, ADFS, Keycloak, Shibboleth

When you first run kubectl, for example, `kubectl get pods`, it will ask you to pick an auth provider and log in with the Rancher server.
The kubeconfig token is cached in the path where you run kubectl under `./.cache/token`. This token is valid till link:../../reference-guides/about-the-api/api-tokens.adoc#setting-ttl-on-kubeconfig-tokens[it expires], or link:../../reference-guides/about-the-api/api-tokens.adoc#deleting-tokens[gets deleted from the Rancher server]
Upon expiration, the next `kubectl get pods` will ask you to log in with the Rancher server again.

_Note_

As of CLI https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.4.10[v2.4.10], the kubeconfig token can be cached at a chosen path with `cache-dir` flag or env var `RANCHER_CACHE_DIR`.

_*Current Known Issues*_

. If link:../../reference-guides/rancher-manager-architecture/communicating-with-downstream-user-clusters.adoc#4-authorized-cluster-endpoint[authorized cluster endpoint] is enabled for RKE clusters to link:../../how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/manage-clusters/access-clusters/use-kubectl-and-kubeconfig.adoc#authenticating-directly-with-a-downstream-cluster[authenticate directly with downstream cluster] and Rancher server goes down, all kubectl calls will fail after the kubeconfig token expires. No new kubeconfig tokens can be generated if Rancher server isn't accessible.
. If a kubeconfig token is deleted from Rancher link:../../reference-guides/about-the-api/api-tokens.adoc#deleting-tokens[API tokens] page, and the token is still cached, cli won't ask you to login again until the token expires or is deleted.
`kubectl` calls will result into an error like `error: You must be logged in to the server (the server has asked for the client to provide credentials`. Tokens can be deleted using `rancher token delete`.

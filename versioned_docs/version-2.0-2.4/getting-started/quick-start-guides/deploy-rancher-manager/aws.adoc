= Rancher AWS Quick Start Guide
:description: Read this step by step Rancher AWS guide to quickly deploy a Rancher Server with a single node cluster attached.

The following steps will quickly deploy a Rancher Server on AWS with a single node cluster attached.

NOTE: The intent of these guides is to quickly launch a sandbox that you can use to evaluate Rancher. These guides are not intended for production environments. For comprehensive setup instructions, see xref:../../installation-and-upgrade/installation-and-upgrade.adoc[Installation].

== Prerequisites

NOTE: Deploying to Amazon AWS will incur charges.

* https://aws.amazon.com/account/[Amazon AWS Account]: An Amazon AWS Account is required to create resources for deploying Rancher and Kubernetes.
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html[Amazon AWS Access Key]: Use this link to follow a tutorial to create an Amazon AWS Access Key if you don't have one yet.
* Install https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html[Terraform]: Used to provision the server and cluster in Amazon AWS.

== Getting Started

. Clone https://github.com/rancher/quickstart[Rancher Quickstart] to a folder using `+git clone https://github.com/rancher/quickstart+`.
. Go into the AWS folder containing the Terraform files by executing `cd quickstart/aws`.
. Rename the `terraform.tfvars.example` file to `terraform.tfvars`.
. Edit `terraform.tfvars` and customize the following variables:
 ** `aws_access_key` - Amazon AWS Access Key
 ** `aws_secret_key` - Amazon AWS Secret Key
 ** `rancher_server_admin_password` - Admin password for created Rancher server
. *Optional:* Modify optional variables within `terraform.tfvars`.
See the https://github.com/rancher/quickstart[Quickstart Readme] and the https://github.com/rancher/quickstart/tree/master/rancher/aws#readme[AWS Quickstart Readme] for more information.
Suggestions include:
 ** `aws_region` - Amazon AWS region, choose the closest instead of the default
 ** `prefix` - Prefix for all created resources
 ** `instance_type` - EC2 instance size used, minimum is `t3a.medium` but `t3a.large` or `t3a.xlarge` could be used if within budget
. Run `terraform init`.
. To initiate the creation of the environment, run `terraform apply --auto-approve`. Then wait for output similar to the following:
+
----
 Apply complete! Resources: 16 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

 Outputs:

 rancher_node_ip = xx.xx.xx.xx
 rancher_server_url = https://rancher.xx.xx.xx.xx.sslip.io
 workload_node_ip = yy.yy.yy.yy
----

. Paste the `rancher_server_url` from the output above into the browser. Log in when prompted (default username is `admin`, use the password set in `rancher_server_admin_password`).

==== Result

Two Kubernetes clusters are deployed into your AWS account, one running Rancher Server and the other ready for experimentation deployments. Please note that while this setup is a great way to explore Rancher functionality, a production setup should follow our high availability setup guidelines.

=== What's Next?

Use Rancher to create a deployment. For more information, see xref:../deploy-workloads/deploy-workloads.adoc[Creating Deployments].

== Destroying the Environment

. From the `quickstart/aws` folder, execute `terraform destroy --auto-approve`.
. Wait for confirmation that all resources have been destroyed.

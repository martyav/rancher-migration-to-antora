= 3. Install Kubernetes with RKE (Kubernetes Installs Only)

This section is about how to prepare to launch a Kubernetes cluster which is used to deploy Rancher server for your air gapped environment.

Since a Kubernetes Installation requires a Kubernetes cluster, we will create a Kubernetes cluster using https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/[Rancher Kubernetes Engine] (RKE). Before being able to start your Kubernetes cluster, you'll need to https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/installation/[install RKE] and create a RKE config file.

* <<a-create-an-rke-config-file,A. Create an RKE Config File>>
* <<b-run-rke,B. Run RKE>>
* <<c-save-your-files,C. Save Your Files>>

=== A. Create an RKE Config File

From a system that can access ports 22/tcp and 6443/tcp on your host nodes, use the sample below to create a new file named `rancher-cluster.yml`. This file is a Rancher Kubernetes Engine configuration file (RKE config file), which is a configuration for the cluster you're deploying Rancher to.

Replace values in the code sample below with help of the _RKE Options_ table. Use the IP address or DNS names of the xref:./prepare-nodes.adoc[3 nodes] you created.

TIP: For more details on the options available, see the RKE https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/config-options/[Config Options].+++<figcaption>+++RKE Options+++</figcaption>+++

|===
| Option | Required | Description

| `address`
| ✓
| The DNS or IP address for the node within the air gap network.

| `user`
| ✓
| A user that can run docker commands.

| `role`
| ✓
| List of Kubernetes roles assigned to the node.

| `internal_address`
| optional^1^
| The DNS or IP address used for internal cluster traffic.

| `ssh_key_path`
|
| Path to SSH private key used to authenticate to the node (defaults to `~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
|===

____
^1^ Some services like AWS EC2 require setting the `internal_address` if you want to use self-referencing security groups or firewalls.

=== B. Run RKE

After configuring `rancher-cluster.yml`, bring up your Kubernetes cluster:

----
rke up --config ./rancher-cluster.yml
----

=== C. Save Your Files

IMPORTANT: The files mentioned below are needed to maintain, troubleshoot and upgrade your cluster.

Save a copy of the following files in a secure location:

* `rancher-cluster.yml`: The RKE cluster configuration file.
* `kube_config_rancher-cluster.yml`: The https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/kubeconfig/[Kubeconfig file] for the cluster, this file contains credentials for full access to the cluster.
* `rancher-cluster.rkestate`: The https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/installation/#kubernetes-cluster-state[Kubernetes Cluster State file], this file contains credentials for full access to the cluster. +
 +
_The Kubernetes Cluster State file is only created when using RKE v0.2.0 or higher._

NOTE: The "rancher-cluster" parts of the two latter file names are dependent on how you name the RKE cluster configuration file.

= 4.  Install Rancher

Rancher installation is managed using the Helm package manager for Kubernetes.  Use `helm` to install the prerequisite and charts to install Rancher.

For systems without direct internet access, see xref:../../air-gap-helm2/install-rancher.adoc[Air Gap: Kubernetes install].

Refer to the xref:../../../../resources/helm-version-requirements.adoc[Helm version requirements] to choose a version of Helm to install Rancher.

NOTE: The installation instructions assume you are using Helm 2. The instructions will be updated for Helm 3 soon. In the meantime, if you want to use Helm 3, refer to https://github.com/ibrokethecloud/rancher-helm3[these instructions.]

=== Add the Helm Chart Repository

Use `helm repo add` command to add the Helm chart repository that contains charts to install Rancher. For more information about the repository choices and which is best for your use case, see xref:../../../../resources/choose-a-rancher-version.adoc[Choosing a Version of Rancher].

NOTE: Upgrades are not supported to, from, or between Alphas.

=== Choose your SSL Configuration

Rancher Server is designed to be secure by default and requires SSL/TLS configuration.

There are three recommended options for the source of the certificate.

NOTE: If you want terminate SSL/TLS externally, see link:chart-options.adoc#external-tls-termination[TLS termination on an External Load Balancer].

|===
| Configuration | Chart option | Description | Requires cert-manager

| <<rancher-generated-certificates,Rancher Generated Certificates>>
| `ingress.tls.source=rancher`
| Use certificates issued by Rancher's generated CA (self signed) +
This is the *default*
| <<optional-install-cert-manager,yes>>

| <<let-s-encrypt,Let's Encrypt>>
| `ingress.tls.source=letsEncrypt`
| Use https://letsencrypt.org/[Let's Encrypt] to issue a certificate
| <<optional-install-cert-manager,yes>>

| <<certificates-from-files,Certificates from Files>>
| `ingress.tls.source=secret`
| Use your own certificate files by creating Kubernetes Secret(s)
| no
|===

=== Optional: Install cert-manager

NOTE: cert-manager is only required for certificates issued by Rancher's generated CA (`ingress.tls.source=rancher`) and Let's Encrypt issued certificates (`ingress.tls.source=letsEncrypt`). You should skip this step if you are using your own certificate files (option `ingress.tls.source=secret`) or if you use link:chart-options.adoc#external-tls-termination[TLS termination on an External Load Balancer].

IMPORTANT: Due to an issue with Helm v2.12.0 and cert-manager, please use Helm v2.12.1 or higher.

____
Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade. If you are upgrading Rancher and using a version of cert-manager older than v0.12.0, please see our xref:../../../../resources/upgrade-cert-manager.adoc[upgrade documentation].
____

Rancher relies on https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager[cert-manager] to issue certificates from Rancher's own generated CA or to request Let's Encrypt certificates.

These instructions are adapted from the https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/getting-started/install/kubernetes.html#installing-with-helm[official cert-manager documentation].

----
 helm install \
   --name cert-manager \
   --namespace cert-manager \
   --version v0.14.2 \

----

Once you've installed cert-manager, you can verify it is deployed correctly by checking the cert-manager namespace for running pods:

----
kubectl get pods --namespace cert-manager

NAME                                            READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
cert-manager-7cbdc48784-rpgnt                   1/1     Running     0          3m
cert-manager-webhook-5b5dd6999-kst4x            1/1     Running     0          3m
cert-manager-cainjector-3ba5cd2bcd-de332x       1/1     Running     0          3m
----

If the '`webhook`' pod (2nd line) is in a ContainerCreating state, it may still be waiting for the Secret to be mounted into the pod. Wait a couple of minutes for this to happen but if you experience problems, please check the https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/getting-started/troubleshooting.html[troubleshooting] guide.

==== Rancher Generated Certificates

NOTE: You need to have <<optional-install-cert-manager,cert-manager>> installed before proceeding.

The default is for Rancher to generate a CA and uses `cert-manager` to issue the certificate for access to the Rancher server interface. Because `rancher` is the default option for `ingress.tls.source`, we are not specifying `ingress.tls.source` when running the `helm install` command.

* Set the `hostname` to the DNS name you pointed at your load balancer.
* If you are installing an alpha version, Helm requires adding the `--devel` option to the command.

----
helm install rancher-<CHART_REPO>/rancher \
  --name rancher \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  --set hostname=rancher.my.org
----

Wait for Rancher to be rolled out:

----
kubectl -n cattle-system rollout status deploy/rancher
Waiting for deployment "rancher" rollout to finish: 0 of 3 updated replicas are available...
deployment "rancher" successfully rolled out
----

==== Let's Encrypt

NOTE: You need to have <<optional-install-cert-manager,cert-manager>> installed before proceeding.

This option uses `cert-manager` to automatically request and renew https://letsencrypt.org/[Let's Encrypt] certificates. This is a free service that provides you with a valid certificate as Let's Encrypt is a trusted CA. This configuration uses HTTP validation (`HTTP-01`) so the load balancer must have a public DNS record and be accessible from the internet.

In the following command,

* Set `hostname` to the public DNS record that resolves to your load balancer.
* Set `ingress.tls.source` to `letsEncrypt`.
* Set `letsEncrypt.email` to the email address used for communication about your certificate (for example, expiry notices).
* Set `letsEncrypt.ingress.class` to whatever your ingress controller is, e.g., `traefik`, `nginx`, `haproxy`, etc.
* If you are installing an alpha version, Helm requires adding the `--devel` option to the command.

----
helm install rancher-<CHART_REPO>/rancher \
  --name rancher \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  --set hostname=rancher.my.org \
  --set ingress.tls.source=letsEncrypt \
  --set letsEncrypt.email=me@example.org \
  --set letsEncrypt.ingress.class=nginx
----

Wait for Rancher to be rolled out:

----
kubectl -n cattle-system rollout status deploy/rancher
Waiting for deployment "rancher" rollout to finish: 0 of 3 updated replicas are available...
deployment "rancher" successfully rolled out
----

==== Certificates from Files

Create Kubernetes secrets from your own certificates for Rancher to use.

NOTE: The `Common Name` or a `Subject Alternative Names` entry in the server certificate must match the `hostname` option, or the ingress controller will fail to configure correctly. Although an entry in the `Subject Alternative Names` is technically required, having a matching `Common Name` maximizes compatibility with older browsers/applications. If you want to check if your certificates are correct, see link:../../../../../../faq/technical-items.adoc#how-do-i-check-common-name-and-subject-alternative-names-in-my-server-certificate[How do I check Common Name and Subject Alternative Names in my server certificate?]

* Set `hostname` and set `ingress.tls.source` to `secret`.
* If you are installing an alpha version, Helm requires adding the `--devel` option to the command.

----
helm install rancher-<CHART_REPO>/rancher \
  --name rancher \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  --set hostname=rancher.my.org \
  --set ingress.tls.source=secret
----

If you are using a Private CA signed certificate , add `--set privateCA=true` to the command:

----
helm install rancher-<CHART_REPO>/rancher \
  --name rancher \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  --set hostname=rancher.my.org \
  --set ingress.tls.source=secret
  --set privateCA=true
----

Now that Rancher is deployed, see xref:tls-secrets.adoc[Adding TLS Secrets] to publish the certificate files so Rancher and the ingress controller can use them.

After adding the secrets, check if Rancher was rolled out successfully:

----
kubectl -n cattle-system rollout status deploy/rancher
Waiting for deployment "rancher" rollout to finish: 0 of 3 updated replicas are available...
deployment "rancher" successfully rolled out
----

If you see the following error: `error: deployment "rancher" exceeded its progress deadline`, you can check the status of the deployment by running the following command:

----
kubectl -n cattle-system get deploy rancher
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
rancher   3         3         3            3           3m
----

It should show the same count for `DESIRED` and `AVAILABLE`.

=== Advanced Configurations

The Rancher chart configuration has many options for customizing the install to suit your specific environment. Here are some common advanced scenarios.

* xref:../../../../../../reference-guides/installation-references/helm-chart-options.adoc[HTTP Proxy]
* link:../../../../../../reference-guides/installation-references/helm-chart-options.adoc#private-registry-and-air-gap-installs[Private Docker Image Registry]
* link:chart-options.adoc#external-tls-termination[TLS Termination on an External Load Balancer]

See the xref:chart-options.adoc[Chart Options] for the full list of options.

=== Save your options

Make sure you save the `--set` options you used. You will need to use the same options when you upgrade Rancher to new versions with Helm.

=== Finishing Up

That's it you should have a functional Rancher server. Point a browser at the hostname you picked and you should be greeted by the colorful login page.

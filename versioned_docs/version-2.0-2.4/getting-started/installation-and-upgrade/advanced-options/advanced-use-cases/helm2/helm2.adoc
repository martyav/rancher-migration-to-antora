= Kubernetes Installation Using Helm 2

____
After Helm 3 was released, the Rancher installation instructions were updated to use Helm 3.

If you are using Helm 2, we recommend https://helm.sh/blog/migrate-from-helm-v2-to-helm-v3/[migrating to Helm 3] because it is simpler to use and more secure than Helm 2.

This section provides a copy of the older high-availability Kubernetes Rancher installation instructions that used Helm 2, and it is intended to be used if upgrading to Helm 3 is not feasible.
____

For production environments, we recommend installing Rancher in a high-availability configuration so that your user base can always access Rancher Server. When installed in a Kubernetes cluster, Rancher will integrate with the cluster's etcd database and take advantage of Kubernetes scheduling for high-availability.

This procedure walks you through setting up a 3-node cluster with Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) and installing the Rancher chart with the Helm package manager.

IMPORTANT: The Rancher management server can only be run on an RKE-managed Kubernetes cluster. Use of Rancher on hosted Kubernetes or other providers is not supported.

IMPORTANT: For the best performance, we recommend a dedicated Kubernetes cluster for the Rancher management server. Running user workloads on this cluster is not advised. After deploying Rancher, you can xref:../../../../../how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup.adoc[create or import clusters] for running your workloads.

== Recommended Architecture

* DNS for Rancher should resolve to a Layer 4 load balancer (TCP)
* The Load Balancer should forward port TCP/80 and TCP/443 to all 3 nodes in the Kubernetes cluster.
* The Ingress controller will redirect HTTP to HTTPS and terminate SSL/TLS on port TCP/443.
* The Ingress controller will forward traffic to port TCP/80 on the pod in the Rancher deployment.+++<figcaption>+++Kubernetes Rancher install with layer 4 load balancer, depicting SSL termination at ingress controllers+++</figcaption>+++

== Required Tools

The following CLI tools are required for this install. Please make sure these tools are installed and available in your `$PATH`

* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl[kubectl] - Kubernetes command-line tool.
* https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/installation/[rke] - Rancher Kubernetes Engine, cli for building Kubernetes clusters.
* https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm[helm] - Package management for Kubernetes. Refer to the xref:../../../resources/helm-version-requirements.adoc[Helm version requirements] to choose a version of Helm to install Rancher.

____
*Important: RKE add-on install is only supported up to Rancher v2.0.8*

Please use the Rancher Helm chart to install Rancher on a Kubernetes cluster. For details, see the xref:../../../resources/helm-version-requirements.adoc[Kubernetes Install].

If you are currently using the RKE add-on install method, see xref:../../../install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster/upgrades/migrating-from-rke-add-on.adoc[Migrating from a Kubernetes Install with an RKE Add-on] for details on how to move to using the Helm chart.

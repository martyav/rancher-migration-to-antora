= Amazon ALB Configuration

____
==== *Important: RKE add-on install is only supported up to Rancher v2.0.8*

Please use the Rancher Helm chart to install Kubernetes Rancher. For details, see the xref:../../../../../resources/choose-a-rancher-version.adoc[Kubernetes Install].

If you are currently using the RKE add-on install method, see xref:../../../../../install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster/upgrades/migrating-from-rke-add-on.adoc[Migrating from a Kubernetes Install with an RKE Add-on] for details on how to start using the Helm chart.

== Objectives

Configuring an Amazon ALB is a multistage process. We've broken it down into multiple tasks so that it's easy to follow.

. <<create-target-group,Create Target Group>>
+
Begin by creating one target group for the http protocol. You'll add your Linux nodes to this group.

. <<register-targets,Register Targets>>
+
Add your Linux nodes to the target group.

. <<create-your-alb,Create Your ALB>>
+
Use Amazon's Wizard to create an Application Load Balancer. As part of this process, you'll add the target groups you created in *1. Create Target Groups*.

== Create Target Group

Your first ALB configuration step is to create one target group for HTTP.

Log into the https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon AWS Console] to get started.

The document below will guide you through this process. Use the data in the tables below to complete the procedure.

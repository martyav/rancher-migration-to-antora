= Syslog

If your organization uses https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424[Syslog], you can configure Rancher to send it Kubernetes logs. Afterwards, you can log into your Syslog server to view logs.

____
*Prerequisite:* You must have a Syslog server configured.
____

If you are using rsyslog, please make sure your rsyslog authentication mode is `x509/name`.

== Syslog Server Configuration

. In the *Endpoint* field, enter the IP address and port for your Syslog server. Additionally, in the dropdown, select the protocol that your Syslog server uses.
. In the *Program* field, enter the name of the application sending logs to your Syslog server, e.g. `Rancher`.
. If you are using a cloud logging service, e.g. https://www.sumologic.com/[Sumologic], enter a *Token* that authenticates with your Syslog server. You will need to create this token in the cloud logging service.
. Select a *Log Severity* for events that are logged to the Syslog server. For more information on each severity level, see the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424#page-11[Syslog protocol documentation].
 ** By specifying a *Log Severity* does not mean that will act as a filtering mechanism for logs. To do that you should use a parser on the Syslog server.

== Encryption Configuration

If your Syslog server is using *TCP* protocol and uses TLS, you need to select *Use TLS* and complete the *Encryption Configuration* form.

. Provide the *Client Private Key* and *Client Certificate*. You can either copy and paste them or upload them by using the *Read from a file* button.
 ** You can use either a self-signed certificate or one provided by a certificate authority.
 ** You can generate a self-signed certificate using an openssl command. For example:
+
----
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout myservice.key -out myservice.cert -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=myservice.example.com"
----
. Select whether or not you want to verify your SSL.
 ** If you are using a self-signed certificate, select *Enabled - Input trusted server certificate*, provide the *CA Certificate PEM*. You can copy and paste the certificate or upload it using the *Read from a file* button.
 ** If you are using a certificate from a certificate authority, select *Enabled - Input trusted server certificate*. You do not need to provide a *CA Certificate PEM*.

= Elasticsearch

If your organization uses https://www.elastic.co/[Elasticsearch], either on premise or in the cloud, you can configure Rancher to send it Kubernetes logs. Afterwards, you can log into your Elasticsearch deployment to view logs.

*Prerequisites:* Configure an https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/saas-release/ec-create-deployment.html[Elasticsearch deployment].

== Elasticsearch Deployment Configuration

. In the *Endpoint* field, enter the IP address and port of your Elasticsearch instance. You can find this information from the dashboard of your Elasticsearch deployment.
 ** Elasticsearch usually uses port `9200` for HTTP and `9243` for HTTPS.
. If you are using https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/xpack-introduction.html[X-Pack Security], enter your Elasticsearch *Username* and *Password* for authentication.
. Enter an https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index-patterns.html[Index Pattern].

== SSL Configuration

If your instance of Elasticsearch uses SSL, your *Endpoint* will need to begin with `https://`. With the correct endpoint, the *SSL Configuration* form is enabled and ready to be completed.

. Provide the *Client Private Key* and *Client Certificate*. You can either copy and paste them or upload them by using the *Read from a file* button.
 ** You can use either a self-signed certificate or one provided by a certificate authority.
 ** You can generate a self-signed certificate using an openssl command. For example:
+
----
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout myservice.key -out myservice.cert -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=myservice.example.com"
----
. Enter your *Client Key Password*.
. Enter your *SSL Version*. The default version is `TLSv1_2`.
. Select whether or not you want to verify your SSL.
 ** If you are using a self-signed certificate, select *Enabled - Input trusted server certificate*, provide the *CA Certificate PEM*. You can copy and paste the certificate or upload it using the *Read from a file* button.
 ** If you are using a certificate from a certificate authority, select *Enabled - Input trusted server certificate*. You do not need to provide a *CA Certificate PEM*.

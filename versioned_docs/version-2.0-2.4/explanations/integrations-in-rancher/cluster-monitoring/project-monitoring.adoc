= Project Monitoring
:experimental:

_Available as of v2.2.4_

Using Rancher, you can monitor the state and processes of your cluster nodes, Kubernetes components, and software deployments through integration with https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus], a leading open-source monitoring solution.

=== Monitoring Scope

Using Prometheus, you can monitor Rancher at both the xref:cluster-monitoring.adoc[cluster level] and project level. For each cluster and project that is enabled for monitoring, Rancher deploys a Prometheus server.

* link:cluster-monitoring.adoc/[Cluster monitoring] allows you to view the health of your Kubernetes cluster. Prometheus collects metrics from the cluster components below, which you can view in graphs and charts.
 ** Kubernetes control plane
 ** etcd database
 ** All nodes (including workers)
* Project monitoring allows you to view the state of pods running in a given project. Prometheus collects metrics from the project's deployed HTTP and TCP/UDP workloads.

=== Permissions to Configure Project Monitoring

Only xref:../../../how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/global-permissions.adoc[administrators], link:../../../how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/cluster-and-project-roles.adoc#cluster-roles[cluster owners or members], or link:../../../how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/cluster-and-project-roles.adoc#project-roles[project owners] can configure project level monitoring. Project members can only view monitoring metrics.

=== Enabling Project Monitoring

____
*Prerequisite:* Cluster monitoring must be xref:cluster-monitoring.adoc[enabled.]
____

. Go to the project where monitoring should be enabled. Note: When cluster monitoring is enabled, monitoring is also enabled by default in the *System* project.
. Select menu:Tools[Monitoring] in the navigation bar.
. Select *Enable* to show the xref:./prometheus.adoc[Prometheus configuration options]. Enter in your desired configuration options.
. Click *Save*.

=== Project-Level Monitoring Resource Requirements

| Container | CPU - Request | Mem - Request | CPU - Limit | Mem - Limit | Configurable

| Grafana

*Result:* A single application,`project-monitoring`, is added as an xref:../../../how-to-guides/new-user-guides/helm-charts-in-rancher/helm-charts-in-rancher.adoc[application] to the project. After the application is `active`, you can start viewing project metrics through the link:cluster-monitoring.adoc/[Rancher dashboard] or directly from Grafana.

____
The default username and password for the Grafana instance will be `admin/admin`. However, Grafana dashboards are served via the Rancher authentication proxy, so only users who are currently authenticated into the Rancher server have access to the Grafana dashboard.
____

=== Project Metrics

link:./expression.adoc#workload-metrics[Workload metrics] are available for the project if monitoring is enabled at the link:cluster-monitoring.adoc/[cluster level] and at the <<enabling-project-monitoring,project level.>>

You can monitor custom metrics from any https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/[exporters.] You can also expose some custom endpoints on deployments without needing to configure Prometheus for your project.

____
*Example:*
A https://redis.io/[Redis] application is deployed in the namespace `redis-app` in the project `Datacenter`. It is monitored via https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter[Redis exporter]. After enabling project monitoring, you can edit the application to configure the *Advanced Options \-> Custom Metrics* section. Enter the `Container Port` and `Path` and select the `Protocol`.
____

To access a project-level Grafana instance,

. From the *Global* view, navigate to a cluster that has monitoring enabled.
. Go to a project that has monitoring enabled.
. From the project view, click *Apps.* In versions before v2.2.0, choose *Catalog Apps* on the main navigation bar.
. Go to the `project-monitoring` application.
. In the `project-monitoring` application, there are two `/index.html` links: one that leads to a Grafana instance and one that leads to a Prometheus instance. When you click the Grafana link, it will redirect you to a new webpage for Grafana, which shows metrics for the cluster.
. You will be signed in to the Grafana instance automatically. The default username is `admin` and the default password is `admin`. For security, we recommend that you log out of Grafana, log back in with the `admin` password, and change your password.

*Results:* You will be logged into Grafana from the Grafana instance. After logging in, you can view the preset Grafana dashboards, which are imported via the https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/#dashboards[Grafana provisioning mechanism], so you cannot modify them directly. For now, if you want to configure your own dashboards, clone the original and modify the new copy.

= Setting up the vSphere Cloud Provider

In this section, you'll learn how to set up the vSphere cloud provider for a Rancher managed RKE Kubernetes cluster in vSphere.

Follow these steps while creating the vSphere cluster in Rancher:

. Set *Cloud Provider* option to `Custom`.

. Click on *Edit as YAML*
. Insert the following structure to the pre-populated cluster YAML. As of Rancher v2.3+, this structure must be placed under `rancher_kubernetes_engine_config`. In versions before v2.3, it has to be defined as a top-level field. Note that the `name` _must_ be set to `vsphere`.

[,yaml]
----
 rancher_kubernetes_engine_config: # Required as of Rancher v2.3+
   cloud_provider:
       name: vsphere
       vsphereCloudProvider:
           [Insert provider configuration]
----

Rancher uses RKE (the Rancher Kubernetes Engine) to provision Kubernetes clusters. Refer to the https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/config-options/cloud-providers/vsphere/config-reference/[vSphere configuration reference in the RKE documentation] for details about the properties of the `vsphereCloudProvider` directive.

= Secrets
:experimental:

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#overview-of-secrets[Secrets] store sensitive data like passwords, tokens, or keys. They may contain one or more key value pairs.

____
This page is about secrets in general. For details on setting up a private registry, refer to the section on xref:kubernetes-and-docker-registries.adoc[registries.]
____

When configuring a workload, you'll be able to choose which secrets to include. Like config maps, secrets can be referenced by workloads as either an environment variable or a volume mount.

Mounted secrets will be updated automatically unless they are mounted as subpath volumes. For details on how updated secrets are propagated, refer to the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#mounted-secrets-are-updated-automatically[Kubernetes documentation.]

== Creating Secrets

When creating a secret, you can make it available for any deployment within a project, or you can limit it to a single namespace.

. From the *Global* view, select the project containing the namespace(s) where you want to add a secret.
. From the main menu, select menu:Resources[Secrets]. Click *Add Secret*.
. Enter a *Name* for the secret.
+
NOTE: Kubernetes classifies secrets, certificates, and registries all as https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[secrets], and no two secrets in a project or namespace can have duplicate names. Therefore, to prevent conflicts, your secret must have a unique name among all secrets within your workspace.

. Select a *Scope* for the secret. You can either make the registry available for the entire project or a single namespace.
. From *Secret Values*, click *Add Secret Value* to add a key value pair. Add as many values as you need.
+
[TIP]
====
You can add multiple key value pairs to the secret by copying and pasting.

. Click *Save*.

*Result:* Your secret is added to the project or namespace, depending on the scope you chose. You can view the secret in the Rancher UI from the menu:Resources[Secrets] view.

Mounted secrets will be updated automatically unless they are mounted as subpath volumes. For details on how updated secrets are propagated, refer to the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#mounted-secrets-are-updated-automatically[Kubernetes documentation.]

== What's Next?

Now that you have a secret added to the project or namespace, you can add it to a workload that you deploy.

For more information on adding secret to a workload, see xref:workloads-and-pods/deploy-workloads.adoc[Deploying Workloads].

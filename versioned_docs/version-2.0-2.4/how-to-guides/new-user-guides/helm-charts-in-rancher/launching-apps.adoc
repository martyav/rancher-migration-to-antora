= Launching Catalog Apps

Within a project, when you want to deploy applications from catalogs, the applications available in your project will be based on the link:helm-charts-in-rancher.adoc#catalog-scopes[scope of the catalogs].

If your application is using ingresses, you can program the ingress hostname to an external DNS by setting up a xref:globaldns.adoc[Global DNS entry].

* <<launching-a-catalog-app,Launching a catalog app>>
* <<configuration-options,Configuration options>>

== Prerequisites

When Rancher deploys a catalog app, it launches an ephemeral instance of a Helm service account that has the permissions of the user deploying the catalog app. Therefore, a user cannot gain more access to the cluster through Helm or a catalog application than they otherwise would have.

To launch an app from a catalog in Rancher, you must have at least one of the following permissions:

* A link:../../advanced-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/cluster-and-project-roles.adoc#project-roles[project-member role] in the target cluster, which gives you the ability to create, read, update, and delete the workloads
* A link:../../advanced-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/cluster-and-project-roles.adoc#cluster-roles[cluster owner role] for the cluster that include the target project

Before launching an app, you'll need to either xref:./built-in.adoc[enable a built-in global catalog] or xref:./adding-catalogs.adoc[add your own custom catalog.]

== Launching a Catalog App

. From the *Global* view, open the project that you want to deploy an app to.
. From the main navigation bar, choose *Apps*. In versions before v2.2.0, choose *Catalog Apps* on the main navigation bar. Click *Launch*.
. Find the app that you want to launch, and then click *View Now*.
. Under *Configuration Options* enter a *Name*. By default, this name is also used to create a Kubernetes namespace for the application.
 ** If you would like to change the *Namespace*, click *Customize* and enter a new name.
 ** If you want to use a different namespace that already exists, click *Customize*, and then click *Use an existing namespace*. Choose a namespace from the list.
. Select a *Template Version*.
. Complete the rest of the *Configuration Options*.
 ** For native Helm charts (i.e., charts from the *Helm Stable* or *Helm Incubator* catalogs), answers are provided as key value pairs in the *Answers* section.
 ** Keys and values are available within *Detailed Descriptions*.
 ** When entering answers, you must format them using the syntax rules found in https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#the-format-and-limitations-of---set[Using Helm: The format and limitations of --set], as Rancher passes them as `--set` flags to Helm. For example, when entering an answer that includes two values separated by a comma (i.e., `abc, bcd`), wrap the values with double quotes (i.e., `"abc, bcd"`).
. Review the files in *Preview*. When you're satisfied, click *Launch*.

*Result*: Your application is deployed to your chosen namespace. You can view the application status from the project's *Workloads* view or *Apps* view. In versions before v2.2.0, this is the *Catalog Apps* view.

== Configuration Options

For each Helm chart, there are a list of desired answers that must be entered in order to successfully deploy the chart. When entering answers, you must format them using the syntax rules found in https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#the-format-and-limitations-of---set[Using Helm: The format and limitations of --set], as Rancher passes them as `--set` flags to Helm.

For example, when entering an answer that includes two values separated by a comma (i.e. `abc, bcd`), it is required to wrap the values with double quotes (i.e., `"abc, bcd"`).

[tabs]
====
Tab UI::
+
### Using a questions.yml file If the Helm chart that you are deploying contains a `questions.yml` file, Rancher's UI will translate this file to display an easy to use UI to collect the answers for the questions. ### Key Value Pairs for Native Helm Charts For native Helm charts (i.e., charts from the **Helm Stable** or **Helm Incubator** catalogs or a [custom Helm chart repository](./catalog-config.md#custom-helm-chart-repository)), answers are provided as key value pairs in the **Answers** section. These answers are used to override the default values. 

Tab Editing YAML Files::
+
_Available as of v2.1.0_ If you do not want to input answers using the UI, you can choose the **Edit as YAML** option. With this example YAML: ```YAML outer: inner: value servers: - port: 80 host: example ``` ### Key Value Pairs You can have a YAML file that translates these fields to match how to [format custom values so that it can be used with `--set`](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/using_helm.md#the-format-and-limitations-of---set). These values would be translated to: ``` outer.inner=value servers[0].port=80 servers[0].host=example ``` ### YAML files _Available as of v2.2.0_ You can directly paste that YAML formatted structure into the YAML editor. By allowing custom values to be set using a YAML formatted structure, Rancher has the ability to easily customize for more complicated input values (e.g. multi-lines, array and JSON objects).

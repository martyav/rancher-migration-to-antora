You can always assign a pod security policy (PSP) to an existing project if you didn't assign one during creation.

=== Prerequisites

* Create a Pod Security Policy within Rancher. Before you can assign a default PSP to an existing project, you must have a PSP available for assignment. For instruction, see xref:../authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/create-pod-security-policies.adoc[Creating Pod Security Policies].
* Assign a default Pod Security Policy to the project's cluster. You can't assign a PSP to a project until one is already applied to the cluster. For more information, see xref:../manage-clusters/add-a-pod-security-policy.adoc[the documentation about adding a pod security policy to a cluster].

=== Applying a Pod Security Policy

. From the *Global* view, find the cluster containing the project you want to apply a PSP to.
. From the main menu, select *Projects/Namespaces*.
. Find the project that you want to add a PSP to. From that project, select menu:&#8942;[Edit].
. From the *Pod Security Policy* drop-down, select the PSP you want to apply to the project.
  Assigning a PSP to a project will:

* Override the cluster's default PSP.
* Apply the PSP to the project.
* Apply the PSP to any namespaces you add to the project later.

. Click *Save*.

*Result:* The PSP is applied to the project and any namespaces added to the project.

NOTE: Any workloads that are already running in a cluster or project before a PSP is assigned will not be checked to determine if they comply with the PSP. Workloads would need to be cloned or upgraded to see if they pass the PSP.

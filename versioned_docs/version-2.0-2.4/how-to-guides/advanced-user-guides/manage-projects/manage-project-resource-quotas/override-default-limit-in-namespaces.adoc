= Overriding the Default Limit for a Namespace
:experimental:

Although the *Namespace Default Limit* propagates from the project to each namespace when created, in some cases, you may need to increase (or decrease) the quotas for a specific namespace. In this situation, you can override the default limits by editing the namespace.

In the diagram below, the Rancher administrator has a resource quota in effect for their project. However, the administrator wants to override the namespace limits for `Namespace 3` so that it has more resources available. Therefore, the administrator xref:../../manage-clusters/projects-and-namespaces.adoc[raises the namespace limits] for `Namespace 3` so that the namespace can access more resources.

=== Editing Namespace Resource Quotas

If there is a xref:manage-project-resource-quotas.adoc[resource quota] configured for a project, you can override the namespace default limit to provide a specific namespace with access to more (or less) project resources.

. From the *Global* view, open the cluster that contains the namespace for which you want to edit the resource quota.
. From the main menu, select *Projects/Namespaces*.
. Find the namespace for which you want to edit the resource quota. Select menu:&#8942;[Edit].
. Edit the Resource Quota *Limits*.  These limits determine the resources available to the namespace. The limits must be set within the configured project limits.
+
For more information about each *Resource Type*, see xref:manage-project-resource-quotas.adoc[Resource Quotas].

[NOTE]
====


* If a resource quota is not configured for the project, these options will not be available.
* If you enter limits that exceed the configured project limits, Rancher will not let you save your edits.
====

*Result:* Your override is applied to the namespace's resource quota.

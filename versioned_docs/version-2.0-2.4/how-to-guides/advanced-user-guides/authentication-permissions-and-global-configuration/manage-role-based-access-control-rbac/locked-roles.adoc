= Locked Roles

You can set roles to a status of `locked`. Locking roles prevent them from being assigned users in the future.

Locked roles:

* Cannot be assigned to users that don't already have it assigned.
* Are not listed in the *Member Roles* drop-down when you are adding a user to a cluster or project.
* Do not affect users assigned the role before you lock the role. These users retain access that the role provides.
+
*Example:* let's say your organization creates an internal policy that users assigned to a cluster are prohibited from creating new projects. It's your job to enforce this policy.
+
To enforce it, before you add new users to the cluster, you should lock the following roles: `Cluster Owner`, `Cluster Member`, and `Create Projects`. Then you could create a new custom role that includes the same permissions as a *Cluster Member*, except the ability to create projects. Then, you use this new custom role when adding users to a cluster.

Roles can be locked by the following users:

* Any user assigned the `Administrator` global permission.
* Any user assigned the `Custom Users` permission, along with the `Manage Roles` role.

== Locking/Unlocking Roles

If you want to prevent a role from being assigned to users, you can set it to a status of `locked`.

You can lock roles in two contexts:

* When you're xref:custom-roles.adoc[adding a custom role].
* When you editing an existing role (see below).

. From the *Global* view, select *Security* > *Roles*.
. From the role that you want to lock (or unlock), select *&#8942;* > *Edit*.
. From the *Locked* option, choose the *Yes* or *No* radio button. Then click *Save*.

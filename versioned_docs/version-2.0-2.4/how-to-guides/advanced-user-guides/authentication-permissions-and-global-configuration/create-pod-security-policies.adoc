= Creating Pod Security Policies

_Pod Security Policies_ (or PSPs) are objects that control security-sensitive aspects of pod specification (like root privileges).

If a pod does not meet the conditions specified in the PSP, Kubernetes will not allow it to start, and Rancher will display an error message of `+Pod <NAME> is forbidden: unable to validate...+`.

== How PSPs Work

You can assign PSPs at the cluster or project level.

PSPs work through inheritance:

* By default, PSPs assigned to a cluster are inherited by its projects, as well as any namespaces added to those projects.
* *Exception:* Namespaces that are not assigned to projects do not inherit PSPs, regardless of whether the PSP is assigned to a cluster or project. Because these namespaces have no PSPs, workload deployments to these namespaces will fail, which is the default Kubernetes behavior.
* You can override the default PSP by assigning a different PSP directly to the project.

Any workloads that are already running in a cluster or project before a PSP is assigned will not be checked if it complies with the PSP. Workloads would need to be cloned or upgraded to see if they pass the PSP.

== Default PSPs

_Available as of v2.0.7_

Rancher ships with two default Pod Security Policies (PSPs): the `restricted` and `unrestricted` policies.

=== Restricted

This policy is based on the Kubernetes https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/master/content/en/examples/policy/restricted-psp.yaml[example restricted policy]. It significantly restricts what types of pods can be deployed to a cluster or project. This policy:

* Prevents pods from running as a privileged user and prevents escalation of privileges.
* Validates that server-required security mechanisms are in place (such as restricting what volumes can be mounted to only the core volume types and preventing root supplemental groups from being added.

=== Unrestricted

This policy is equivalent to running Kubernetes with the PSP controller disabled. It has no restrictions on what pods can be deployed into a cluster or project.

== Creating PSPs

Using Rancher, you can create a Pod Security Policy using our GUI rather than creating a YAML file.

=== Requirements

Rancher can only assign PSPs for clusters that are xref:../../new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/launch-kubernetes-with-rancher/launch-kubernetes-with-rancher.adoc[launched using RKE.]

You must enable PSPs at the cluster level before you can assign them to a project. This can be configured by xref:../../../reference-guides/cluster-configuration/cluster-configuration.adoc[editing the cluster.]

It is a best practice to set PSP at the cluster level.

We recommend adding PSPs during cluster and project creation instead of adding it to an existing one.

=== Creating PSPs in the Rancher UI

. From the *Global* view, select *Security* > *Pod Security Policies* from the main menu. Then click *Add Policy*.
+
*Step Result:* The *Add Policy* form opens.

. Name the policy.
. Complete each section of the form. Refer to the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/[Kubernetes documentation] for more information on what each policy does.

== Configuration

The Kubernetes documentation on PSPs is https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/[here.]

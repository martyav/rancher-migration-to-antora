= Istio Setup Guides

This section describes how to enable Istio and start using it in your projects.

This section assumes that you have Rancher installed, and you have a Rancher-provisioned Kubernetes cluster where you would like to set up Istio.

If you use Istio for traffic management, you will need to allow external traffic to the cluster. In that case, you will need to follow all of the steps below.

*Quick Setup* If you don't need external traffic to reach Istio, and you just want to set up Istio for monitoring and tracing traffic within the cluster, skip the steps for xref:set-up-istio-gateway.adoc[setting up the Istio gateway] and xref:set-up-traffic-management.adoc[setting up Istio's components for traffic management.]

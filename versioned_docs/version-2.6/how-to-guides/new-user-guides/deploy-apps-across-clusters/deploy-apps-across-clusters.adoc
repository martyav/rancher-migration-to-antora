= Deploying Applications across Clusters

Rancher offers several ways to deploy applications across clusters, depending on version.

== Fleet

Rancher v2.5 introduced Fleet, a new way to deploy applications across clusters.

Continuous Delivery with Fleet is GitOps at scale. For more information, refer to the xref:fleet.adoc[Fleet section].

=== Multi-cluster Apps

In Rancher before v2.5, the multi-cluster apps feature was used to deploy applications across clusters. The multi-cluster apps feature is deprecated, but still available as a legacy feature.

See the xref:multi-cluster-apps.adoc[multi-cluster app documentation] for more details.

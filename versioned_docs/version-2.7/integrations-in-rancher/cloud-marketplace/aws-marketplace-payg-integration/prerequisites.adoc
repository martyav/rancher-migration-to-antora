Before using Rancher Prime on AWS as a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) offering, you need the following resources, information, and tools:

* A Rancher-compatible EKS cluster. For more details, see the https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/[Rancher support matrix]. Refer to xref:../../../getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster/rancher-on-amazon-eks.adoc[Creating an EKS cluster] for bringing up an EKS cluster to xref:installing-rancher-prime.adoc[install Rancher Prime PAYG].
* An ingress on the EKS cluster, so that Rancher is accessible from outside the cluster. See the link:../../../getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster/rancher-on-amazon-eks.adoc#5-install-an-ingress[Rancher documentation] for instructions on deploying Ingress-NGINX on an EKS cluster.
* The Load Balancer IP address. See the link:../../../getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster/rancher-on-amazon-eks.adoc#6-get-load-balancer-ip[Rancher documentation] for how to find it, then save the `EXTERNAL-IP`.
* The Rancher hostname. The hostname must be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), and its corresponding IP address must be resolvable from a public DNS. See the link:../../../getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster/rancher-on-amazon-eks.adoc#7-set-up-dns[Rancher documentation] for instructions on how to set up DNS. This DNS points to the `EXTERNAL-IP`.

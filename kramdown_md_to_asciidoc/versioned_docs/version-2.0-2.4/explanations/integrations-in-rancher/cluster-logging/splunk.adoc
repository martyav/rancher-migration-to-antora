= Splunk

If your organization uses https://www.splunk.com/[Splunk], you can configure Rancher to send it Kubernetes logs. Afterwards, you can log into your Splunk server to view logs.

____
*Prerequisites:*

* Configure HTTP event collection for your Splunk Server (Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud).
* Either create a new token or copy an existing token.

For more information, see http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.1.2/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector#About_Event_Collector_tokens[Splunk Documentation].

== Splunk Configuration

. In the *Endpoint* field, enter the IP address and port for you Splunk instance (i.e. `+http://splunk-server:8088+`)
 ** Splunk usually uses port `8088`. If you're using Splunk Cloud, you'll need to work with https://www.splunk.com/en_us/support-and-services.html[Splunk support] to get an endpoint URL.
. Enter the *Token* you obtained while completing the prerequisites (i.e., when you created a token in Splunk).
. In the *Source* field, enter the name of the token as entered in Splunk.
. *Optional:* Provide one or more http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.1.2/Indexer/Aboutindexesandindexers[index] that's allowed for your token.

== SSL Configuration

If your instance of Splunk uses SSL, your *Endpoint* will need to begin with `https://`. With the correct endpoint, the *SSL Configuration* form is enabled and ready to be completed.

. Provide the *Client Private Key* and *Client Certificate*. You can either copy and paste them or upload them by using the *Read from a file* button.
 ** You can use either a self-signed certificate or one provided by a certificate authority.
 ** You can generate a self-signed certificate using an openssl command. For example:
+
----
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout myservice.key -out myservice.cert -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=myservice.example.com"
----
. Enter your *Client Key Password*.
. Select whether or not you want to verify your SSL.
 ** If you are using a self-signed certificate, select *Enabled - Input trusted server certificate*, provide the *CA Certificate PEM*. You can copy and paste the certificate or upload it using the *Read from a file* button.
 ** If you are using a certificate from a certificate authority, select *Enabled - Input trusted server certificate*. You do not need to provide a *CA Certificate PEM*.

== Viewing Logs

. Log into your Splunk server.
. Click on *Search & Reporting*. The number of *Indexed Events* listed should be increasing.
. Click on Data Summary and select the Sources tab.

. To view the actual logs, click on the source that you declared earlier.

== Troubleshooting

You can use curl to see if *HEC* is listening for HTTP event data.

 $ curl http://splunk-server:8088/services/collector/event \
     -H 'Authorization: Splunk 8da70994-b1b0-4a79-b154-bfaae8f93432' \
     -d '{"event": "hello world"}'

If Splunk is configured correctly, you should receive *json* data returning `success code 0`. You should be able
to send logging data to HEC.

If you received an error, check your configuration in Splunk and Rancher.

= Creating a GKE Cluster

== Prerequisites in Google Kubernetes Engine

NOTE: Deploying to GKE will incur charges.

Create a service account using https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/serviceaccounts[Google Kubernetes Engine]. GKE uses this account to operate your cluster. Creating this account also generates a private key used for authentication.

The service account requires the following roles:

* *Compute Viewer:* `roles/compute.viewer`
* *Project Viewer:* `roles/viewer`
* *Kubernetes Engine Admin:* `roles/container.admin`
* *Service Account User:* `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`

== Create the GKE Cluster

Use Rancher to set up and configure your Kubernetes cluster.

. From the *Clusters* page, click *Add Cluster*.
. Choose *Google Kubernetes Engine*.
. Enter a *Cluster Name*.
. Use *Member Roles* to configure user authorization for the cluster. Click *Add Member* to add users that can access the cluster. Use the *Role* drop-down to set permissions for each user.
. Either paste your service account private key in the *Service Account* text box or *Read from a file*. Then click *Next: Configure Nodes*.
+
NOTE: After submitting your private key, you may have to enable the Google Kubernetes Engine API. If prompted, browse to the URL displayed in the Rancher UI to enable the API.

. Select your *Cluster Options*
. Customize your *Node Options*
 ** Enabling the Auto Upgrade feature for Nodes is not recommended.
. Select your *Security Options*
. Review your options to confirm they're correct. Then click *Create*.

*Result:*

Your cluster is created and assigned a state of *Provisioning.* Rancher is standing up your cluster.

You can access your cluster after its state is updated to *Active.*

*Active* clusters are assigned two Projects:

* `Default`, containing the `default` namespace
* `System`, containing the `cattle-system`, `ingress-nginx`, `kube-public`, and `kube-system` namespaces

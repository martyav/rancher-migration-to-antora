= Tutorial: Example Custom Chart Creation

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a Helm chart and deploy it to a  repository. The repository can then be used as a source for a custom catalog in Rancher.

You can fill your custom catalogs with either Helm Charts or Rancher Charts, although we recommend Rancher Charts due to their enhanced user experience.

____
For a complete walkthrough of developing charts, see the upstream Helm chart https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/[developer reference].
____

. Within the GitHub repo that you're using as your custom catalog, create a directory structure that mirrors the structure listed in the link:./creating-apps.adoc#chart-directory-structure[Chart Directory Structure].
+
Rancher requires this directory structure, although `app-readme.md` and `questions.yml` are optional.
+
[TIP]
====


* To begin customizing a chart, copy one from either the https://github.com/rancher/charts[Rancher Library] or the https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable[Helm Stable].
* For a complete walk through of developing charts, see the upstream Helm chart https://docs.helm.sh/developing_charts/[developer reference].
====

. *Recommended:* Create an `app-readme.md` file.
+
Use this file to create custom text for your chart's header in the Rancher UI. You can use this text to notify users that the chart is customized for your environment or provide special instruction on how to use it.
 +
 +
 *Example*:
+
----
 $ cat ./app-readme.md

 # Wordpress ROCKS!
----

. *Recommended:* Create a `questions.yml` file.
+
This file creates a form for users to specify deployment parameters when they deploy the custom chart. Without this file, users *must* specify the parameters manually using key value pairs, which isn't user-friendly.
 +
 +
 The example below creates a form that prompts users for persistent volume size and a storage class.
 +
 +
 For a list of variables you can use when creating a `questions.yml` file, see link:./creating-apps.adoc#question-variable-reference[Question Variable Reference].
+
[,yaml]
----
     categories:
     - Blog
     - CMS
     questions:
     - variable: persistence.enabled
       default: "false"
       description: "Enabling persistent volume for WordPress"
       type: boolean
       required: true
       label: WordPress Persistent Volume Enabled
       show_subquestion_if: true
       group: "WordPress Settings"
       subquestions:
       - variable: persistence.size
         default: "10Gi"
         description: "WordPress Persistent Volume Size"
         type: string
         label: WordPress Volume Size
       - variable: persistence.storageClass
         default: ""
         description: "If undefined or null, uses the default StorageClass. Default to null"
         type: storageclass
         label: Default StorageClass for WordPress
----

. Check the customized chart into your GitHub repo.

*Result:* Your custom chart is added to the repo. Your Rancher Server will replicate the chart within a few minutes.

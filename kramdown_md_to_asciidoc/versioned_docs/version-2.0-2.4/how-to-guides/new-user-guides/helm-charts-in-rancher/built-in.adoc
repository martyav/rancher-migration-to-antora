= Enabling and Disabling Built-in Global Catalogs
:experimental:

There are default global catalogs packaged as part of Rancher.

Within Rancher, there are default catalogs packaged as part of Rancher. These can be enabled or disabled by an administrator.

____
*Prerequisites:* In order to manage the built-in catalogs or manage global catalogs, you need _one_ of the following permissions:

* xref:../../advanced-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/global-permissions.adoc[Administrator Global Permissions]
* link:../../advanced-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/global-permissions.adoc#custom-global-permissions[Custom Global Permissions] with the link:../../advanced-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/global-permissions.adoc#custom-global-permissions-reference[Manage Catalogs] role assigned.
____

. From the *Global* view, choose menu:Tools[Catalogs] in the navigation bar. In versions before v2.2.0, you can select *Catalogs* directly in the navigation bar.
. Toggle the default catalogs that you want to be enabled or disabled:
 ** *Library:*	The Library Catalog includes charts curated by Rancher. Rancher stores charts in a Git repository to expedite the fetch and update of charts. This catalog features Rancher Charts, which include some link:./creating-apps.adoc#rancher-charts[notable advantages] over native Helm charts.
 ** *Helm Stable:* This catalog, which is maintained by the Kubernetes community, includes native https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/[Helm charts]. This catalog features the largest pool of apps.
 ** *Helm Incubator:* Similar in user experience to Helm Stable, but this catalog is filled with applications in *beta*.

*Result*: The chosen catalogs are enabled. Wait a few minutes for Rancher to replicate the catalog charts. When replication completes, you'll be able to see them in any of your projects by selecting *Apps* from the main navigation bar. In versions before v2.2.0, within a project, you can select *Catalog Apps* from the main navigation bar.

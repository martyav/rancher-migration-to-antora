= Adding a Sidecar
:experimental:

A _sidecar_ is a container that extends or enhances the main container in a pod. The main container and the sidecar share a pod, and therefore share the same network space and storage. You can add sidecars to existing workloads by using the *Add a Sidecar* option.

. From the *Global* view, open the project running the workload you want to add a sidecar to.
. Click menu:Resources[Workloads.] In versions before v2.3.0, select the *Workloads* tab.
. Find the workload that you want to extend. Select menu:&#8942; icon (...)[Add a Sidecar].
. Enter a *Name* for the sidecar.
. Select a *Sidecar Type*. This option determines if the sidecar container is deployed before or after the main container is deployed.
 ** *Standard Container:*
+
The sidecar container is deployed after the main container.

 ** *Init Container:*
+
The sidecar container is deployed before the main container.
. From the *Docker Image* field, enter the name of the Docker image that you want to deploy in support of the main container. During deployment, Rancher pulls this image from https://hub.docker.com/explore/[Docker Hub]. Enter the name exactly as it appears on Docker Hub.
. Set the remaining options. You can read about them in xref:deploy-workloads.adoc[Deploying Workloads].
. Click *Launch*.

*Result:* The sidecar is deployed according to your parameters. Following its deployment, you can view the sidecar by selecting menu:&#8942; icon (...)[Edit] for the main deployment.

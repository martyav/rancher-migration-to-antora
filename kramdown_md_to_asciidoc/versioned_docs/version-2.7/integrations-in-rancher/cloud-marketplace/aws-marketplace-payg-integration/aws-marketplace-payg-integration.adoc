= AWS Marketplace Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) Integration

== Overview

Rancher Prime integrates with the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace[AWS Marketplace] as a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) offering. This brings the value of running and managing Kubernetes environments to AWS customers, benefiting from a new pay-monthly pricing model available through the AWS Marketplace. This listing will enable you to manage any CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution in AWS, on-prem, or at the edge.

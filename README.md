# Welcome

Welcome to the Rancher Product Docs. We are currently a work in progress. We are migrating the [Rancher docs](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/) site to run on the Antora site generator instead of Docusaurus. As such, some of the information in this repo's README and other files might be inaccurate or organized in an odd way. 

If ypu're looking to update the current iteration of the docs, please visit [https://github.com/rancher/rancher-docs](https://github.com/rancher/rancher-docs).
